Our cloud storage solution aims to combine the features of the traditional cloud storage systems, and the reliability and security from the decentralised web to create a safe and reliable storage option for our users.
We believe that the web3 is the future of the internet, and want to establish a trustless , permissionless, and Open cloud storage platform.
The internet is at the dawn of a new age, where the traditional model of computing and corporation controlled services, is rapidly antiquating. Ushering in web3 is the new generation, comprising ambitious developers willing to upend the status quo to improve security, and maintain privacy in a world where our data has become a commodity.

## Why is this so awesome? ü§©


* üîí **Secure:** Each file on the machine is encrypted symmetrically with a randomly generated salt, and pepper included while hashing so that the traditional cracking methods like Rainbow Tables are not effective. A malicious party who retrieves the file from IPFS can't do anything with it since they can't decrypt it.


* üåê **Decentralized:** With Web3.Storage you get all the benefits of Decentralized Storage technologies with the frictionless experience you expect in a modern dev workflow. There is effectively zero downtime, and even if a server is tampered with, the data is present on 2 other nodes, and hence the storage service can never be disrupted. HTTP downloads files from one server at a time ‚Äî but peer-to-peer IPFS retrieves pieces from multiple nodes at once, enabling substantial bandwidth savings. The web of tomorrow needs IPFS today. IPFS aims to surpass HTTP in order to build a better web for all of us. Today's web is inefficient and expensive.With up to 60% savings for video, IPFS makes it possible to efficiently distribute high volumes of data.


* üìÅ **Unrestricted Access** Files stored on IPFS are resistant to tampering and censorship. IPFS powers the creation of diversely resilient networks that enable persistent availability ‚Äî with or without internet backbone connectivity

## What problem does this solve?
* Cloud Storage options are expensive. We provide a cheaper alternative with the added benefit of security and decentralisation.
* The decentralized system adopts data redundancy and load balancing to speed up and secure data retrieval and data storage. 
  As mutliple copies of the data are available at various nodes, even if one node stops working, it does not lead to data loss. 
   Load balancing systems optimize the entire network and restricts traffic concentrated at a single location, so the access time is reduced.
* The IPFS does not implement Access-Control by default, and so all data on the network is available to all users by design. We implement Access Control.
